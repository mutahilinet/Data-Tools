# üìñ About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

This project demonstrates an **library management system** implemented using Supabase (PostgreSQL).
It integrates Row Level Security (RLS), Admin & User roles, and custom SQL policies to control data access and enforce least privilege principles.

The System includes tables: authors,publishers,students,books,borrow_records 
- ‚úÖ UUID-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- ‚úÖ Role-based access policies (Admin vs Regular User)
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ‚úÖ A secure function for admin-only operations

---

## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- **Supabase** ‚Äì PostgreSQL + Auth + Policy Management  
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Structured database engine and tables  
- **RLS Policies** - Fine-grained access control
- **SQL Functions** ‚Äì Role-based admin actions

## üöÄ Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>

- [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pwsbzyjjqwxtqzzpaghy)  

---

## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites
- Supabase account
- Basic SQL and PostgreSQL knowledge
-Git installed
- GitHub account for project submission  

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evans-dotcom/Data-Tools/tree/Data_Fundamentals-Branch
cd Data-Tools
```

```bash
Usage

Open Supabase SQL editor

Run schema.sql to create tables & sample data

Apply UUID + RLS setup:
Enable Row Level Security

ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tickets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;


Apply user vs admin policies.
```

## üíæ Sample SQL Queries & Policies <a name="sample-sql-queries"></a>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Policies
```sql
-- CREATE POLICY "Students can view their own borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR SELECT
USING (
  auth.uid() = (
    SELECT p.id
    FROM profiles p
    JOIN students s ON s.student_id = borrow_records.student_id
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Students can insert their own borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = (
    SELECT p.id
    FROM profiles p
    JOIN students s ON s.student_id = borrow_records.student_id
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid()
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Librarians have full access to borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'librarian'
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'librarian'
  )
);

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Policies
```sql
-- -- Librarians can manage all borrow records
CREATE POLICY "Librarians have full access to borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'librarian'
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM profiles
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'librarian'
  )
);

```

```sql
-- CREATE POLICY "Librarians can manage all books"
ON books
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM profiles
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
    AND profiles.role = 'librarian'
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM profiles
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
    AND profiles.role = 'librarian'
  )
);


CREATE POLICY "Librarians can manage all borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1

 ### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Example CRUD Queries with their output.
 ```sql
-- -- Show borrow records for the currently logged-in student
SELECT 
  br.record_id,
  b.title AS book_title,
  br.borrow_date,
  br.due_date,
  br.return_date
FROM borrow_records br
JOIN books b ON br.book_id = b.book_id
WHERE br.student_id = (
  SELECT s.student_id
  FROM students s
  JOIN profiles p ON p.id = auth.uid()
  WHERE p.role = 'student'
);

```

## User Roles and Output

**User purchases new tickets**
```sql
-- Insert new ticket (User only)
INSERT INTO tickets (event_id, customer_id, quantity, purchase_date)
VALUES (1, 1, 2, '2025-10-30');
```
**View tickets purchased by a specific user**
```sql
SELECT 
  c.full_name AS customer,
  e.event_name,
  e.location,
  t.quantity,
  t.purchase_date
FROM tickets t
JOIN customers c ON t.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN events e ON t.event_id = e.event_id
WHERE c.auth_user_id = 'eb08886f-6f46-4cae-a39e-7ad7619f7046';  -- User‚Äôs auth UID
```
  **Ouput upon Inserting & Viewing their tickets**

## ‚ùì FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**Q: How do I test RLS policies?**  
A: Sign in as User vs Admin and try CRUD operations. Policies will restrict or allow access accordingly.  

**Q: Can I extend this to a front-end?**  
A: Yes, connect Supabase Auth with **Angular**, **Java**, or any front-end framework.
